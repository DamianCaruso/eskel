    Hello, world!
    =============

    This is a [Monk](http://monkrb.com) skeleton that uses [Redis](http://code.google.com/p/redis) as the database and [HAML](http://haml-lang.com/) for the views. This skeleton lives at [http://github.com/monkrb/skeleton](http://github.com/monkrb/skeleton).

    The page you are looking at was generated by `app/routes/home.rb`, and the template is located at `app/views/home.haml`.

    Settings
    --------

    Check the configuration file at `config/settings.yml`. The keys under each environment can be accessed with the global `monk_settings` function, and you will also find an example in the default route.

    Redis is connected to `#{@redis[:host]}:#{@redis[:port]}`. If you want to change it, make sure to edit `config/settings.yml` and `config/redis/#{RACK_ENV}.yml`

    Testing
    -------

    There's user story written for you at `spec/site_spec.rb`. Start adding whatever you want to test and then run `monk test`. For convenience, you can also run `rake`, which just invokes `monk test`.

    Dependencies
    ------------

    Run `bundle install` to install dependencies. Feel free to edit the `Gemfile` file in the root of this project.
